Inconsistencies in structure and between documentation and implementation.

*result*

    The root node `<result/>` sometimes has an attribute called code, otherwise a textnode child representing the result message. posts/delete and posts/add return a `<result code="…"/>`, all other functions return `<result>…</result>`.
  
*posts/get, posts/all, posts/recent*

    Three functions returning the same XML elements, but each time with different attributes on the document root node. Only common attribute is user.

*posts/all*

    Returned <posts/> never has an tag attribute as described in API documentation, not even when filtering on a tag.

*posts/get*

    `dt` argument accepts a full ISO 8601 date (concordant with API help), but the results do not make sense for anything more specific than a date. When filtering using a full ISO 8601 datetime, the `dt` attribute on the `<posts/>` (get) element will reflect the exact passed value however the time attributes of the post elements don't make much sense (shifting as much as a day, API bug?). Filtering on a date seems to work fine (quality is OK, quantity unchecked).
